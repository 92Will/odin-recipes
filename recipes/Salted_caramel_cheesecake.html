    <li>160 g golden or white caster sugar</li>
    <li>500 g cream cheese (room temperature</li>
    <li>250 g mascarpone (room temperature)</li>
    <li>300 ml double cream</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 tablespoon salted caramel spread</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon fudge pieces</li>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p><b>Salted Caramel Cheesecake Biscuit Base</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Lightly grease your baking tin.</li>
    <li>Melt your butter over a low heat in your saucepan. Do not try to speed this up by turning up the heat, it will merely evaporate some of the liquid and you need it all.</li>
    <li>Either pop all of your biscuits in your food processor and blitz into crumbs or pop them into a food bag and whack them with a rolling pin.</li>
    <li>Tip your biscuits into your melted butter and mix thoroughly so all of the biscuits soak up the butter.</li>
    <li>Tip the biscuit base into your tin and press firmly down with the back of a spoon. I actually use a potato masher to press the biscuits down as it has a large, even surface area. </li>
    <li>Refridgerate for 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Salted Caramel Cheesecake Filling</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Pop your sugar, cream cheese, mascarpone and vanilla extract and into your mixer bowl give it a quick spin to mix it all together. Don't worry about the sugar not dissolving, it will.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl beat your cream until it is stiff. You need to stop beating at the right point because if the cream is too soft so will the cheesecake be, if overbeaten it's hitting the brink of being churned and we don't want butter. It won't take long to beat to the right stiffness so keep an eye on it and regularly stop to check and see if it is ready.</li>
    <li>Pop your beaten cream in with your cream cheese mixture and briefly mix it together on a low setting - or fold in by hand. Use your spatula to wipe down the sides and base of the bowl to ensure all of the mixture is equally incorporated.</li>
    <li>Take roughly â…“ of your cheesecake mixture and pop it onto the biscuit base, roughly even out.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle over half of your fudge pieces.</li>
    <li>Melt your salted caramel sauce in your microwave in bouts of 10 seconds, stirring in-between until it is soft, but not hot. Blob four blobs over the cheesecake mixture, spacing out equally, then take a skewer and drag it through the blobs to create a marbled effect.</li>
    <li>Repeat with another layer of cheesecake mixture, caramel and fudge pieces.</li>
    <li>Spread over your final layer of cheesecake mixture.</li>
    <li>Even out this top layer with your small palette knife, so that it is smooth. </li>
    <li>Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight, ie 12 hours. The longer it has the better it sets.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Salted Caramel Cheesecake Topping</b></p>
<ol>
    <li>Remove your cheesecake from your tin after it has set but running a knife around the edge to loosen it, then carefully push the cheesecake out of the tin from the base up. Use a flat spatular or large palette knife to separate the cheesecake from the tin base. Clean away any cheesecake filling that sticks to the base sides using some clean kitchen paper.</li>
    <li>Melt your salted caramel sauce in your microwave in bouts of 10 seconds until runny.</li>
    <li>Drizzle over your cheesecake by dipping in your teaspoon and letting it fall over the top.</li>
    <li>Spread any blobs out using a skewer or cocktail stick.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle over your fudge pieces.</li>
</ol>
