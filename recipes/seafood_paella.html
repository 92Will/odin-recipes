<h2>What is Seafood Paella?</h2>
<p>Paella, in Spanish cuisine is a dish of saffron-flavoured rice cooked with meats, seafood, and vegetables. Originating in the rice-growing areas on Spain's Mediterranean coast, the dish is especially associated with the region of Valencia.</p>

<p>This Authentic Spanish Seafood Paella Recipe is loaded with spanish flavors, and believe it or not, it is very easy to make. I cooked my seafood paella in a typical paella pan, but you can always use a large frying pan if you donÂ´t have a paella pan, but I do recommend a paella pan.</p>
