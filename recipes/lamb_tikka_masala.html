<h2>What is Tikka Masala?</h2>
<p>Tikka literally means “chunks of meat cooked on skewers” in hindi. The Indian word masala often describes spice blends, though the blend and number of spices varies. Many assume tikka masala originated in India. However, some sources say it hails from Britain, while other say Scotland is tikka masala’s homeland.</p>
<p>Whichever side you're on, authentic tikka masala consists of marinated meat (often in yogurt) that gets skewered and cooked over a grill until charred. The charred meat gets simmered in a silky curry sauce made with warm spices, coconut milk, onions, and tomatoes. </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Morton kosher salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds boneless lamb leg, sirloin or shoulder, trimmed and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk plain yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil or ghee</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
    <li>1 serrano, seeded and minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice or basmati rice and/or naan bread</li>
    <li>Cilantro or mint for serving</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Combine 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon cumin, coriander, and pepper in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag. Toss the spices around to combine. Add lamb and shake to coat. Add yogurt, seal bag, and massage meat to coat. Transfer bag to refrigerator and marinate for 1 hour or up to overnight.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch sauté pan over medium. Add onion and remaining 1 teaspoon salt and cook until softened and starting to brown, 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, serrano, and ginger; cook stirring frequently until onions are softened and golden brown, about 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in remaining 1 tablespoon garam masala, remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, and ½ teaspoon cardamom; cook 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands as you add them (or use your kitchen shears to cut them in the can). Bring sauce to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring frequently and scraping up browned bits from bottom of pan, until thickened and deepened in color, 15–20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add coconut milk and simmer until thickened, 5–7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, heat oven to broil (high) with rack set in upper middle position Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange lamb on rack in a single layer (don’t scrape marinade off). Broil lamb until starting to char, 10–12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add lamb to sauce, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lamb is cooked through, about 8 minutes. Serve with rice, cilantro, and naan if desired.</li>
