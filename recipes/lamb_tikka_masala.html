<h2>What is Tikka Masala?</h2>
<p>Tikka literally means “chunks of meat cooked on skewers” in hindi. The Indian word masala often describes spice blends, though the blend and number of spices varies. Many assume tikka masala originated in India. However, some sources say it hails from Britain, while other say Scotland is tikka masala’s homeland.</p>
<p>Whichever side you're on, authentic tikka masala consists of marinated meat (often in yogurt) that gets skewered and cooked over a grill until charred. The charred meat gets simmered in a silky curry sauce made with warm spices, coconut milk, onions, and tomatoes. </p>
