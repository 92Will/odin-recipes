The first project as part of the "The Odin Projects" curriculum

This project requires writing basic code lines to display recipe information and link them to relative paths in an ordered fashion. Git will be used along the way to document and commit meaningful changes to the project to show best practice and real work working situations. 

HTML5 has been used initially, with the plan to emphasis and develop the page with CSS3 and JS in the future
